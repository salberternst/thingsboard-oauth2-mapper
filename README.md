# thingsboard-oauth2-mapper

A small service that maps OAuth 2.0 tokens to thingsboard users. It provides a seamless integration between OAuth 2.0 authentication and the ThingsBoard platform. With this service, you can easily authenticate users using tokens to corresponding ThingsBoard users. This allows for a secure and convenient way to manage user authentication in your ThingsBoard applications. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/).
